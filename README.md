# Non Equilibrium Markers in a Colloidal System

We explore different methods and approaches to analyze the non-equilbrium in a colloidal system, implementing both "passive" and "active" (in a way) measures. The system we are exploring is a colloidal system of paramagnetic particles, over the influence of a oscillating magnetic field, yielding in the generation of currents.

Code here related to the generation of LAMMPS simulations uses the LAMMPS implementation of [Antonio Ortiz-Ambriz](https://github.com/aortiza/magcolloids.git), the supervisor of the project.
